Javascript AUgmented Reality Tries

## Demo

You can see the last rough demo at http://seclab03.cs.rice.edu/rtc/JsAr/index3.html

## Limitation

See the above dmeo in Firefox nightly in an android phone. iOS doesnt allow get usermedia to access camera. And Chrome needs the connection to be secure (https) and at present my demo is hosted in http. But the code istelf works well in Chrome too if hosted in https.
